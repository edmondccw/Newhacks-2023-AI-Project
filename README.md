# CodeGenius - AI-Powered Personalized Programming Tutor

Welcome to CodeGenius, an AI-powered personalized programming tutor! Here's how to run our app:

### Backend:

1. First, navigate to the 'backend' directory using your terminal. 
```cd backend```

2. Install the required Python packages by running the following command, which reads the package dependencies from the 'requirements.txt' file:

    
    ```pip install -r requirements.txt```


3. Once the required packages are installed, you can start the backend server. Run the following command to launch the Flask app:

    ```python app.py```

    This will start the backend server.

### Frontend:


1. In a separate terminal window, navigate to the 'frontend' directory. 
```cd frontend```

2. Install the necessary frontend dependencies. To do this, you should use a package manager like npm or yarn. Here's an example using npm:

    ```npm install```


This will install the required frontend packages.

3. After the dependencies are installed, you can start the frontend development server. Run the following command:

    ```npm start``` 

    This command will start the development server for the React frontend.

4. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to access the CodeGenius app.

### Enjoy!

That's it! You should now have both the backend and frontend running. Feel free to explore, generate coding questions, and practice your programming skills with CodeGenius.

If you encounter any issues or have questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to us. Happy coding!

### Inspiration
Our inspiration for this project came from a desire to address the limitations of existing coding practice platforms. While platforms like LeetCode are excellent for data structures and algorithm questions, they often lack variety in terms of beginner-friendly coding challenges and the ability to prepare for exams. To fill this gap, we created a user-friendly tool, designed to empower novice programmers. Our goal was to provide a space where they could practice coding concepts like loops, Python list comprehensions, JavaScript Promises, and more, perfect for exam preparation or tech skill development.

### What it does
CodeGenius is a user-friendly platform that leverages AI APIs to create customized coding questions and check your answers with feedback. It excels in catering to beginners, generating questions that are beginner-friendly and focused on essential topics like 'for loops.' Users can select their preferred programming language and topic to generate personalized questions, enhancing their learning experience.
